## Bugs and Fixes

-   ### Bug

1. Issue with height on element with class "container-about-content", where it's child element was overflowing.
    In result the background-color aplied did not cover the child element.

2. Issue with the width of the cards on Cottages page because of inline styling which came with bootsrap code.

3. Issue with social links on Home page. On mobile view icons align on the left and did not look the same as on larger screens.

4. Issue with image on the cards of Cottages page. Image being streched when viewed on Iphone 5SE.

-   ### Fix

1.  Add the code:
        
         html{
             height: 100%;
        } 

        body {
            min-height: 100vh;
        }

        .container-about-content {
            min-height: 50vh;
        }

2.  Remove the inline styling and add custom one.        

3. Fixed issue by positioning the icons at the bottom center of the page instead of left. To achieve this adedd properties to the parent element
     and amended the properties of the child element.

4. Fix issue by removing "_margin: 0 auto;_" from class **_card-row_** and add "_margin-left and margin-right -10px_" to the same class and to the 
    **_cottages-heading-container_**, also reduce the padding of **_cottages-container_** from 15px to 10px. 
    Also add media qiery for xs devices and change the "_height_" of the class **_card-cottages_** form 650px to 600px.
    Please note that the orientation of the images on the cards is **Portrait** not **Landscape** !
